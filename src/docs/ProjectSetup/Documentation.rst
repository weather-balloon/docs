Documentation
*************

The documentation you are reading here is created using `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_.
You can access the source code in the `Weather Balloon
<https://dev.azure.com/weatherballoon/_git/Weather%20Balloon>`_ repo. You'll
find the guide for building the documentation in the ``README.md`` file.

Conventions
-----------

I use various diagrams to help illustrate various concepts. Most of the "formal"
diagrams are based in UML but I'm by no means a UML expert so please let me
know if I've slipped up. I reference the `Sparx Systems UML Tutorial
<https://www.sparxsystems.com.au/resources/uml2_tutorial/>`_ to guide me.
