    the weather forecast for my local area



Background

Weather forecast location
-------------------------

These appear to mainly utilise a town/area name (e.g. "Brisbane") but can also
have an associated `shape file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile>`_ that
designates the forecast area.

The Australian BoM describes the forecast spatial data in `a brief
guide <http://reg.bom.gov.au/catalogue/spatialdata.pdf>`_. The shape files are
available via the `BOM's FTP site
<ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/home/adfd/spatial/>`_ under the ``IDM00001.*`` files.
